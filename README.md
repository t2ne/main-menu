## What is this?

This is a very minimal dashboard. It displays a menu of your most-used self-hosted apps and related links, all in one place.  
It’s protected by Cloudflare Zero Trust and not meant for public access.

- No user management
- No backend
- No fancy features—just a static menu page
- Private: only accessible via Cloudflare Zero Trust

## Getting Started

Install dependencies and start in development mode:

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

## Tailnet Status (vpn / up / down)

The UI can only reliably distinguish `vpn` vs `down` if it can reach a tailnet-only HTTP(S) health URL.

On a machine that has Tailscale running, create one:

```bash
sudo tailscale serve --bg --set-path /health 'text:ok'
tailscale serve status
```

Then set:

```bash
PUBLIC_TAILNET_PROBE_URL=https://<device>.your-tailnet.ts.net/health
```

Note: `PUBLIC_*` vars are embedded in client JS (not secret). Keeping `.env` out of git still avoids publishing it in your repo.

Useful commands:

```bash
tailscale serve status
sudo tailscale serve reset
```

If the URL works in terminal but not in the browser (`ERR_NAME_NOT_RESOLVED`), disable Secure DNS / DoH in your browser so it uses the OS resolver (Tailscale DNS).

Customize your links in the source as needed.
